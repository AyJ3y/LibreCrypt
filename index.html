<h2>Please take the survey on <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XFHP5LS">new features</a> for LibreCrypt</h2>   

<h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Easy to use, with a 'wizard' for creating new 'containers'.</li>
<li>Full transparent encryption, containers appear as removable disks in Windows Explorer.</li>
<li>Explorer mode lets you access containers when you don't have admin permissions.</li>
<li>Compatible with Linux encryption, Cryptoloop "losetup", dm-crypt, and LUKS. Linux shell scripts support deniable encryption on Linux.</li>
<li>Supports smartcards and security tokens.</li>
<li>Encrypted containers can be a file, a partition, or a whole disk.</li>
<li>Opens legacy volumes created with FreeOTFE</li>
<li>Runs on Windows Vista onwards (see note below for 64 bit versions).</li>
<li>Supports numerous hash (including SHA-512, RIPEMD-320, Tiger) and encryption algorithms (Including AES, Twofish, and Serpent) in several modes (CBC, LRW, and XTS), giving more options than any other disk encryption software.</li>
<li>Optional 'key files' let you use a thumb-drive as a key.</li>
<li>Portable mode doesn't need to be installed and leaves little trace on 3rd party PCs (administrator rights needed).</li>
<li>Deniable encryption protects you from 'rubber hose cryptography'.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Please note this is a Beta version with some known limitations. Particularly in Portable mode an extra step is needed on 64 bit Windows to avoid the error message "Windows requires a digitally signed driver".</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="release-notes" class="anchor" href="#release-notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Release notes</h2>

<p><em>Important: LibreCrypt Portable mode will not work on Windows Vista and later 64 bit versions without a extra step before use.</em></p>

<p><em>LibreCrypt installed on Windows Vista and later 64 bit versions adds the text "Test Mode" to the Windows desktop. Please see the documentation for details on removing this.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Please follow these instructions to run LibreCrypt in portable mode on 64 bit Windows; if you do not do this you will get the error "Windows requires a digitally signed driver" when starting the drivers. There is no need to do this if LibreCrypt is installed.
<ul>
<li>Start LibreCrypt, click 'No' on the prompt to start the portable drivers, and 'OK' on the warning dialog about not having any loaded drivers.</li>
<li>Click the Tools-&gt;"Allow Test-signed drivers" menu item.</li>
<li>Reboot    </li>
<li>After rebooting the words "Test Mode" appear in the four corners of the Desktop. Please see the documentation for details on removing this.</li>
<li>After finishing with LibreCrypt you can click the Tools-&gt;"Disallow Test-signed drivers" menu item to remove the "Test Mode" text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To run in portable mode, you need to have admin rights.  </li>
<li>Backwards compatibility with PDA and Windows CE versions of FreeOTFE will be removed in the next version.</li>
<li>Backwards compatibility with older versions of FreeOTFE (before 5.21) will be removed in the next version. Please convert any FreeOTFE volumes. This can be done by creating a new 'box' and copying the files across.</li>
<li>Support for the following cyphers will be removed in the next version, please convert to another: xor, plain, single DES. Ditto for the 'plain' hash. </li>
<li>LibreCrypt does not support encryption of the operating system partition, for this I recommend Ubuntu Linux.</li>
<li>LibreCrypt needs to be run as administrator the first time it is run. After that it can be run as an ordinary user. </li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="passwords" class="anchor" href="#passwords"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Passwords</h4>

<p><em>These issues relate to passwords (keyphrases) containing non-ASCII characters, e.g. accented letters and non Latin scripts, <strong>not</strong> to ASCII special characters like '$&amp;^'.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The handling of keyphrases containing non-ASCII characters will change in a future version. This change will not be backwards compatible. So in this version it is recommended to use only ASCII characters in keyphrases.</li>
<li>There are possible bugs in opening volumes created with FreeOTFE with non-ASCII characters. If you experience problems, please use the legacy app to change the password to an ASCII one and retry. Alternatively move the files to a native LibreCrypt.</li>
</ul><p>For more details, please see the <a href="http://DoxBox.eu/doxbox/getting_started.html">getting started guide</a> and <a href="http://DoxBox.eu/doxbox/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
