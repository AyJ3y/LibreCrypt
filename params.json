Linux shell scripts support deniable encryption on Linux.</li>\r\n<li>Supports smartcards and security tokens.</li>\r\n<li>Encrypted DoxBoxes can be a file, a partition, or a whole disk.</li>\r\n<li>Opens legacy volumes created with FreeOTFE</li>\r\n<li>Runs on Windows Vista onwards (see note below for 64 bit versions).</li>\r\n<li>Supports numerous hash (including SHA-512, RIPEMD-320, Tiger) and encryption algorithms (Including AES, Twofish, and Serpent) in several modes (CBC, LRW, and XTS), giving more options than any other disk encryption software.</li>\r\n<li>Optional 'key files' let you use a thumb-drive as a key.</li>\r\n<li>Portable mode doesn't need to be installed and leaves little trace on 3rd party PCs (administrator rights needed).</li>\r\n<li>Deniable encryption protects you from 'rubber hose cryptography'.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please note this is a Beta version with some known limitations. Particularly in Portable mode an extra step is needed on 64 bit Windows to avoid the error message \"Windows requires a digitally signed driver\".</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Release notes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Important: DoxBox Portable mode will not work on Windows Vista and later 64 bit versions without a extra step before use.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>DoxBox installed on Windows Vista and later 64 bit versions adds the text \"Test Mode\" to the Windows desktop. Please see the documentation for details on removing this.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please follow these instructions to run DoxBox in portable mode on 64 bit Windows; if you do not do this you will get the error \"Windows requires a digitally signed driver\" when starting the drivers. There is no need to do this if DoxBox is installed.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Start DoxBox, click 'No' on the prompt to start the portable drivers, and 'OK' on the warning dialog about not having any loaded drivers.</li>\r\n<li>Click the Tools->\"Allow Test-signed drivers\" menu item.</li>\r\n<li>Reboot    </li>\r\n<li>After rebooting the words \"Test Mode\" appear in the four corners of the Desktop. Please see the documentation for details on removing this.</li>\r\n<li>After finishing with DoxBox you can click the Tools->\"Disallow Test-signed drivers\" menu item to remove the \"Test Mode\" text.</li>\r\n</ul></li>\r\n<li>To run in portable mode, you need to have admin rights.  </li>\r\n<li>There is a security flaw in the use of hidden volumes. If you create hidden volumes they may be visible to an attacker. This does not affect normal DoxBoxes and only affects the deniability, not security, of hidden ones.\r\n<!-- *  Support for E4M, Bestcrypt, Crosscrypt and ScramDisc containers may be added in the next version --></li>\r\n<li>Backwards compatibility with PDA and Windows CE versions of FreeOTFE will be removed in the next version.</li>\r\n<li>Backwards compatibility with older versions of FreeOTFE (before 5.21) will be removed in the next version. Please convert any FreeOTFE volumes. This can be done by creating a new 'box' and copying the files across.</li>\r\n<li>Support for the following cyphers will be removed in the next version, please convert to another: xor, plain, single DES. Ditto for the 'plain' hash. </li>\r\n<li>DoxBox does not support encryption of the operating system partition, for this I recommend Ubuntu Linux.</li>\r\n<li>DoxBox needs to be run as administrator the first time it is run. After that it can be run as an ordinary user. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Passwords</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><em>These issues relate to passwords (keyphrases) containing non-ASCII characters, e.g. accented letters and non Latin scripts, <strong>not</strong> to ASCII special characters like '$&amp;^'.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The handling of keyphrases containing non-ASCII characters will change in the next version. This change will not be backwards compatible. So in this version it is recommended to use only ASCII characters in keyphrases.</li>\r\n<li>There are possible bugs in opening volumes created with FreeOTFE with non-ASCII characters. If you experience problems, please use the legacy app to change the password to an ASCII one and retry. Alternatively move the files to a native DoxBox.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For more details, please see the <a href=\"docs/getting_started.md\">getting started guide</a> and <a href=\"docs/FAQ.md\">FAQ</a>.</p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
